# React Native Deprecated Lifecycle Method: componentWillMount

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications: the use of the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method.  `componentWillMount` is no longer supported and may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. This example shows how to correctly replace it with the `useEffect` hook.

## Problem

The `componentWillMount` method was used to initialize state before the component rendered. However, it's now deprecated.  Using it can result in warnings and potential compatibility problems.

## Solution

The recommended solution is to use the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array `[]`. This ensures the code within `useEffect` runs only once after the initial render, similar to `componentWillMount`'s behavior.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start the application.
